Domain-Register-TK

Domain::Register::TK allows developers to create and maintain domains within 
the .TK namespace using Dot TK's reseller program API, without having to know 
the details of how the API program works. Domains can be checked (with price 
provided in local currency) and updated, including using URL forwarding 
services, or manipulating nameserver references.

More information about the Dot TK Reseller API program can be found at 
http://www.dot.tk/en/pageE12.html

DEPENDENCIES

Please note: if you're reading from source, please note that there are 
dependencies.

The included test suite inside "make test" explicity tests for the modules

XML::Simple
LWP

*but*

Because the transport used for communication is HTTPS, there needs to be a 
library installed to enable Secure Socket Layer communications. OpenSSL and 
Crypt::SSL are suggested as possible options. The test suite will only run
successfully if this is done.

INSTALLATION
